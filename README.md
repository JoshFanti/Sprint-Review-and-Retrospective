Software Development
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? You need to make sure that the user needs are meet but also that they work properly and that you have communication with the user on their needs. Mostly focusingon what they need to do within what they provide you within a "user story".
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? When it comes to working on developing programs, the most important things are making sure you meet the user's needs and making sure you work together with your teams to ensure you get things done correctly.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? That you complete your work on time but are also accessable and open to help, when it comes to helping other team members and receiving help from others as well.
